<p><b><u>What is LiteGapps?</u></b>  Litegapps is a package of google applications such as Playstore, Google Play service and so on.  Litegapps is made as light and minimal as possible, and with the help of Magisk it becomes systemless </p>

<p><b><u>Litegapps++ (double plus)</u></b> is the development of "litegapps" which allows it to support almost all versions of android and architecture while maintaining its small size.  There are also MAGISK,RECOVERY,AUTO versions available.</p>

<p><b><u>LiteGapps Controller</u></b> is an additional feature of litegapps or litegapps ++ which aims to fully control litegapps, which contains additional features such as.</p>
<p> • Booster</p>
<p> • Gaming Mode</p>
<p> • Download Package litegapps
<p> • Battery saver</p>
<p> • Gms Dose</p>
<p> • And many others</p>

<p><b><u>The beginnings of Litegapps</u></b></p>
<p>Litegapps is inspired by my habit of always being simple, for years I was looking for the lightest Gapps and I found them but it's not as light as I thought.  actually I don't like GoogleApps because it only takes up RAM, battery and makes your cellphone slow. I only need gapps to sync contacts and download games after that I don't need gapps anymore, so I made this Litegapps!  With Litegapps you can uninstall all Gapps if you don't need them from your phone and your life!  Because this is systemless.
</p>
