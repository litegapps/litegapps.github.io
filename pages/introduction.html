	<p><strong>LiteGapps</strong> is a dedicated google app for the android operating system</p>
	<p>Initially I was looking for lightweight custom Google apps, because I only used Google Apps to download games and applications from Playstore. i found a lightweight custom gapps but it's not quite what i want yet</p>
	<p>It was then that I created my own custom gapps which are lightweight, small and support multiple devices that can be installed <strong>system</strong> or <strong>Systemless</strong></p>
	<p>After I made <strong>litegapps</strong> on the 15th, I thought to make litegapps installable on various devices and versions of Android with one flashable package. that's where "litegapps++" was born with a separate package from the usual <strong>litegapps</strong>.</p>
	<p>in 08-2020 i have made "LiteGapps Controller" for extra features of "litegapps" or "litegapps++" with some tweaks used by users</p>
	<p>after several updates litegapps added variants to complement user needs, with "litegapps variant" you can choose which package you need.</p>
	<p>In May 2022, we also added "addon/packages" so users can install which packages they need manually.</p>
	<p>in july 2022, we made "LiteGapps Remover" as a solution for roms that include gapps and remove them, then you can install litegapps</p>
	<p>so that's an explanation and some introduction you can read further below to find out "project litegapps".</p>
