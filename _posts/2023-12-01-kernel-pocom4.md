# Best Kernel for Poco M4

Poco M4 is a mid-range smartphone that offers a 90Hz display, a 50MP camera, and a 5000mAh battery. It runs on the MediaTek Dimensity 810 chipset, which is a powerful and efficient processor. However, some users may want to customize their device further by installing a custom kernel. A custom kernel can enhance the performance, battery life, stability, and features of the device.

There are not many custom kernels available for Poco M4, as the device is relatively new and the kernel source code has not been released by Xiaomi yet¹³. However, some developers have managed to port some kernels from other devices or create their own kernels based on the stock kernel. In this article, we will review some of the best kernels for Poco M4 based on their features, performance, and user feedback.

## Venom Kernel

Venom Kernel is a kernel based on the stock kernel of Poco M4, but with some tweaks and optimizations. It aims to provide a smooth and stable experience for Poco M4 users. Some of the features of Venom Kernel are:

- Optimized CPU and GPU governors for better performance and battery life
- Enabled F2FS and NTFS support for file systems
- Enabled KCAL and K-Lapse for display calibration and night mode
- Enabled Sound Control and Vibration Control for audio and haptic feedback
- Enabled Fast Charge and USB Fast Charge for faster charging
- Enabled TCP Congestion Control and Network Security for improved network performance and security
- Enabled various debugging and tracing options for developers and testers

Venom Kernel is compatible with most custom ROMs and supports OTA updates. It also has a dedicated Telegram channel where users can get updates and news from the developer.


## Finix Kernel

Finix Kernel is a kernel based on the latest Linux 4.19 source code from Qualcomm and Xiaomi. It aims to provide a smooth and stable experience for Poco M3 users. Some of the features of Finix Kernel are:

- Optimized CPU and GPU governors for better performance and battery life
- Enabled F2FS and NTFS support for file systems
- Enabled KCAL and K-Lapse for display calibration and night mode
- Enabled Sound Control and Vibration Control for audio and haptic feedback
- Enabled Fast Charge and USB Fast Charge for faster charging
- Enabled TCP Congestion Control and Network Security for improved network performance and security
- Enabled various debugging and tracing options for developers and testers

Finix Kernel is compatible with most custom ROMs and supports OTA updates. It also has a dedicated Telegram group where users can get support and feedback from the developer and other users.

## SmartR Kernel

SmartR Kernel is another kernel based on the Linux 4.19 source code from Qualcomm and Xiaomi. It focuses on providing a balanced and stable experience for Poco M3 users. Some of the features of SmartR Kernel are:

- Optimized CPU and GPU governors for balanced performance and battery life
- Enabled F2FS and NTFS support for file systems
- Enabled KCAL and K-Lapse for display calibration and night mode
- Enabled Sound Control and Vibration Control for audio and haptic feedback
- Enabled Fast Charge and USB Fast Charge for faster charging
- Enabled TCP Congestion Control and Network Security for improved network performance and security
- Enabled various debugging and tracing options for developers and testers
