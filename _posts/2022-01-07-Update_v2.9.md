<h2>Added Support Android 14.0</h2>
<p>we will add android 14.0 support
<p>february - august (beta release)
<p>august+ (stable release)</p>
<h2>LiteGapps++</h2>
<p>because the more support for Android versions that are entered, this makes the file size bigger, so we will separate each architecture support</p>

<h2>Android 10 and 11 </h2>
<p>we will leave android 10 and 11 as active development, we will put it in development <strong>archive</strong> (updated at least once a year)</p>
<h2>LiteGapps Controller</h2>
<p>we will remove the online package installer, due to team limitations we cannot update and add to the online installation package list in the litegapps controller</p>
