### Notes

1. [AUTO] which is converted to a magisk module or ksu module (systemless) makes it not work fully 80%, this will cause small problems such as synchronizing Google contacts and others.

2. You can do the uninstaller in any mode, but Google applications such as YouTube, Google Chrome, Google Keyboard will experience several problems such as force close and other problems, so we recommend deleting the updated application first before uninstalling LiteGapps.

3. You can install [MAGISK], [KSU], [RECOVERY], [AUTO] via Magisk Manager, Kernelsu manager or Recovery.

4. If you use **[AUTO]** and install magisk or kernelsu, you can force it to **[RECOVERY]** mode by adding an empty file ``/sdcard/force_kopi``.

5. Make sure that your ROM does not have gapps installed, if it is installed there will be a conflict in the system.
