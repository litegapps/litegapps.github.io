## Systemless

You can do the removal via the module in the magisk, kernelsu, and apatch applications, and don't forget to remove the google application updates before uninstalling the litegapps module.

## Non Systemless
To remove Litegapps, you can reinstall the ROM or use Litegapps Remover.

## Notes

- Before uninstalling, we recommend deleting the update application or applications that you installed, which are related to Google such as YouTube, Chrome, Playstore, Google Playstore and others.  If you don't do this, you will risk force closing the Google app and could even cause a bootloop.
